# Imatic Build Action

image names should be generated by using environment variables provided by this
action. For example:

- `PROJECT_IMAGE` - image name
- `PROJECT_VERSION` - image version

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: ${PROJECT_IMAGE:-my-project-name}:${PROJECT_VERSION:-latest}
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        - MY_APP_VERSION=${PROJECT_VERSION:-latest}
      tags:
        - ${PROJECT_IMAGE:-my-project-name}:${PROJECT_VERSION:-latest}
```
